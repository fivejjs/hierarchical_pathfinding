/// Options for configuring the [`PathCache`](crate::PathCache)
///
/// Default options:
/// ```
/// # use hierarchical_pathfinding::PathCacheConfig;
/// assert_eq!(
///     PathCacheConfig {
///         chunk_size: 8,
///         cache_paths: true,
///         a_star_fallback: true,
///         perfect_paths: false,
///     },
///     Default::default()

/// ```
///
/// ### Performance
/// For testing, a set of different Grids were used:
/// - "empty" is simply an Grid where all costs are `1`.
/// - "snake" has a single long winding corridor
/// - "random" is completely random costs and walls
///
/// Each Grid was tested as 16x16, 128x128 and 1024x1024. The 16x16 Grid, however, produced only
/// durations less than 100 Î¼s, which are too inaccurate to be measured.
///
/// The full List can be seen on [GitHub](https://github.com/mich101mich/hierarchical_pathfinding/blob/benchmark/benchmark/)
/// in the `output_*.txt` files.

/// Conclusions:
/// - Bigger Chunks are usually better
/// - Chunks that take up the entire Grid are useless (see 128x128)

/// for 1024x1024: 100MB - 1000MB, depending on Node density on the Grid.
///
/// Can be drastically reduced by setting `cache_paths` to `false`, at the expense of repeated
/// calculations when using a Path.
